## Introduction

This example shows results from `independentSamplesTTest()` and compares them to results obtained using alternative approaches.

<!-- Describe here what is the objective of the analysis (what part of the analysis is of importance) -->

An example from Hays (1974, pp. 404-407):

> An experimenter working in the area of motivational factors in perception was interested in the effects of deprivation upon the perceived size of objects. Among the studies carried out was one done with orphans, who were compared with nonorphaned children on the basis of the judged size of parental figures viewed at a distance. [...]Now two independent randomly selected groups were used. Sample 1 was a group of orphaned children without foster parents. Sample 2 was a group of children having a normal family with both parents. Both population of children sampled showed the same age level, sex distribution, educational level, and so forth. The question asked by the experimenter was 'Do deprived children tend to judge the parental figures relatively larger than do the nondeprived?' In terms of a null and alternative hypothesis,
<br>
H~0~: $\mu$~1~ - $\mu$~2~ $\le 0$
<br>
H~1~: $\mu$~1~ - $\mu$~2~ $> 0$.
<br>
The $\alpha$ level for significance decided upon was .05.

## Data

<!-- Describe here the dataset (where does it come from, what it contains, etc) -->

The actual results provided by Hays (1974) were

*Sample 1:* M~1~ = 1.8; S1~ = .7; N~1~ = 125

*Sample 2:* M~2~ = 1.6; S2~ = .9; N~2~ = 150

**Note**: A data set with these properties has been simulated using R.

The data set can be obtained in R as follows:

```{r load-data}
set.seed(1)
m1 <- scale(rnorm(125)) * 0.7 + 1.8
m2 <- scale(rnorm(150)) * 0.9 + 1.6
data <- data.frame(
  size   = c(m1, m2), 
  family = rep(c("no", "yes"), times = c(125, 150))
)
```

And the data looks like:

```{r show-data, purl=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(x = head(data), caption = "First five rows of the data set.")
```

## Analysis

<!-- Display results from other analysis programs, and run the JASP analysis here -->

### Manual results

Calculations by hand can be found in Hays, 1974, pp. 404-407.

Result: $t = 2.11$

Significant (two-tailed test) for $\alpha = .05$ or less

<!-- ### SPSS results -->

<!-- Screenshots can be added as follows: -->

### Results using R

```{r run-r-analysis, purl=FALSE}
t.test(formula = size~family, data = data)
```

### JASP results

The analysis can be run as follows:

```{r run-jasp-analysis}
set.seed(1)
results <- jaspTTests::independentSamplesTTest(
  data      = data, 
  dependent = "size", 
  groupBy   = "family"
)
```

And the relevant output is:

```{r show-jasp-results, purl=FALSE}
knitr::kable(results[["ttest"]])
```

<!-- Write here unit tests -->

```{r unit-tests, include=TRUE}
try({testthat::local_edition(3)
testthat::test_that("Welch t-test example by Hays (1974) works", {
  #> Add code here to specify the tests, for example:
  jaspTools::expect_jasp_table(results[["ttest"]])
  #> jaspTools::expect_jasp_plot (results[["mainPlot"]] )
})})
```
